						This past summer 2014, I worked as an animator alongside a team of designers, artists, programmers and more, at <a  class = "mojo_link" href="http://mojogamestudios.com/" target = "blank">Mojo Game Studios</a>, an independent game studio based in Pitsburgh. Our present project is Aderyn's Cradle, a strategic first-person melee-combat game that tells the story of an exiled traveler. We want to create an immersive narrative experience set in a rich environment with diverse ecosystems and luring soundtrack. Currently, I am still an animator working on their first person combat animations. I was given the task to create a series of block animations. All the animations are completed on a dummy rig from first person point of view to be later transfered onto actual models that will be used in the game. One exercise that really helped the process was acting out all of the animations I wanted to create. It's a lot easier to imagine the effect a weighted object has on a shield when you replicate it in real life.
