					Save Me Next Time is an animation short completed in Maya and compiled using Adobe Promiere. I created all the models and animation using Maya. The story line sprung from the concept of companionship and death. What would you do to save your best friend?

						<p class = "about_proj" id = "proj2_process_desc">This was not only a class project, but also a personal long term project. Critter, the happy dino dog, appeared in my head in the beginning of 2012. He slowly evolved from a derpy adorable quick sketch into a more sophisticated concept drawing until finally taking his current 3d form this year. Not only did this process teach me character design and development, I also gained experience in texturing. His large, antlered friend is a hybrid between a beetle and a moose.</p>

							</div>
							<p class = "about_proj" id ="bandit_desc">Inspiration can emerge from the most unexpected places. My german shepherd, Bandit, was my biggest influence for creating Critter. He lives with his sister and my grandparents on their farm, which is a long distance from my house. This fun-loving, free-caring, silly dog manages to brighten up my day every time I visit. I wanted to borrow Bandit's personality into Critter. He is kind, loyal and stubborn; he would repeatedly get himself into trouble because he's trying to help you. Yet even after being repeatedly scolded, he still welcomes you with a large smile and a wagging tail.</p>
