					<p><a href = "https://www.tiktok.com/tag/horrify" target = "_blank" class = "link">Horrify</a> is a creative tool I launched that exaggerates a user's smile while segmenting them out from the background and applying red pupils. It earned viral levels of usage in United States and other countries. </p>
					<br>
					<p>I designed the 3D face deformation and worked with engineers and designers to fine-tune the reactivity of the effect. I overcame our 3D face deformation technology limitations by implementing creative light-weight solutions.</p>

					<p>
						For this effect, I wanted the smile to be extremely exaggerated to push the scary impact of the visuals. During production, we ran into limitations with the current
						3D deformation algorithm. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Our effect has several states:
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						1. closed mouth - no smile 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						2. closed mouth - smile 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p> 3. open mouth - no smile 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p> 4. open mouth - smile 
					</p> 
					<br>
					<p>  However, such an exaggerated blendshape applied to the face would create artifacts in the mouth area when users smiled but kept their mouths closed. This is due to the fact that, when users smiled but kept their mouth closed, their lip texture was the only available texture to stretch over the "opened mouth" area of the blendshape. 
				</div>

				<div class = "photo_wrapper x2 left">
					<img class = "photo" src = "Portfolio/TikTok/solution.jpg" style = "width:80%; margin:auto">
				</div>
				<div class = "photo_wrapper x2 right">
					<div class = "summary design" style = "margin-bottom: 60px;">
						<p>
							To combat this problem, I created a unique blendshape for each "closed mouth" and "open mouth" states. 
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							The "closed mouth" blendshape would have a slightly less exaggerated smile that cleaned up the artifacts around the mouth. If users smiled without opening their mouths, the deformation would be controlled by the "closed mouth" blendshape. 
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							If users opened their mouth, then the effect would seemlessly blend into the "open mouth" blendshape, resulting in a much more exaggerated final look and smooth transition. 
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Not only did this creative solution solve our issues with 
							visual artifacting, it also did not require additional new algorithms and allowed us to finish this effect on time. Users really enjoyed the exaggerated look of this creative tool and earned us almost 2 million videos in the United States.

						Throughout the preparation for release, I led the brainstorm, visual direction, and integration for several music effects. I deligated tasks to various designers, connected necessary cross-functional teams, and maintained an efficient timeline. I collaborated with UI designers and Interactive Engineers to create a cohesive visual language used across all immersive music effects, helping users better identify new effect features. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>To promote the initiative internally, I gave company-wide presentations explaining the novel interactive music reactive features, and bringing together cross-functional teammates to start new idea brainstorms.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p> To promote the initiative externally, I gave interviews with other collaborators to speak about our design pipeline and collaboration process. You can see the video below.
