				 We developed the physical and virtual environments together. This was a highly iterative process. To gain better spacial understanding of our project, we role-played the experience in the final physical room. This gave me world positions to transfer into a virtual room and position the virtual character's movements. I created prototypes in Unity to test Vuforia within our physical installation and programmed all of Adam's interactions with the Player.

			<p><strong>Goal </strong><i>&#8212 Explore the potential of character driven XR narratives, through the combined use of physical and virtual puzzles.</i></p>
			<p><strong>Result </strong>&#8212 MAAD was 70% successful.</p><p> We achieved our goal of combining the physical and virtual environment into a single believable space through physical puzzles and an adorable virtual character, Adam.  We recieved lots of positive reactions towards Adam. The spacialized sound triggers and confined environment helped orient the Player, but Players still have some difficulty determining goals. Sometimes Players are uncertain about what they are allowed to do. Unstable hardware tracking also added to Player's dissatisfaction.</p>
