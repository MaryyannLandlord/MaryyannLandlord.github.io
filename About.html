					<p>Hi, I'm Maryyann.</p>
					<p>I'm an animator pursuing an MFA at University of Southern California, and graduated with a BFA at Carnegie Mellon University. I love creating whimsical work that evokes memorable experiences and exploring ways to transform a viewer into a participant.
					</p>
					<p>I've always believed in utilizing the power of technology to discover new forms of animation. Recently, I've been exploring interactive components that allow users to personalize his or her viewing experience.
					</p>
					<p>When I'm not glued to the computer, I'm practicing piano or sketching for <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/l0nelypeach/" target = "_blank" class = "link">my Instagram</a>. I adore horseback riding, Hayao Miyazaki movies, computer programming, and classical music. I have a strong interest and 
					appreciation for graphic design, and recently picked up Dota 2. I worked as a digital artist intern at <a href = "http://disneyresearch.com/" target = "_blank"; class = "link">Disney Research</a>,
					and currently am an animator/3d modeler for the <a href = "http://mobilemedia.usc.edu/content/home" target = "_blank" class = "link">Mobile and Environmental Media Lab</a> at USC.
