					<p>Hi, I'm Maryyann.</p>
					<p>I'm an Animator majoring in Electronic Time Based Art at Carnegie Mellon University. I love creating whimsical work that evokes memorable experiences, often combining reality and fantasy. For me, animation is a powerful tool with unlimited possibilities.
					</p>
					<p>I've always believed in taking full advantage of this limitless platform. I like using animation to exaggerate reality until fiction and nonfiction become inseparable from each other. 
					</p>
					<p>When I'm not glued to the computer, I'm practicing piano or taking
					photos for the school newspaper. I adore horseback riding, Hayao Miyazaki movies, 
					computer programming, and classical music. I have a strong interest and 
					appreciation for graphic design, and recently 
					picked up Guitar Hero 3. Currently, I am an animator for <a href = http://mojogamestudios.com/ target = "_blank"; class = "mojo_link">Mojo Games Studios</a>,
					an Indie game company where I also interned Summer 2014. 
					  </p>
