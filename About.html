					<p>Hi, I'm Maryyann.</p>
					<p>I'm an Animator majoring in Electronic Time Based Art at Carnegie Mellon University. I love creating whimsical work that evokes memorable experiences and exploring ways to transform a viewer into a participant.
					</p>
					<p>I've always believed in utilizing the power of technology to discover new forms of animation. Recently, I've been exploring interactive components that allow users to personalize his or her viewing experience.
					</p>
					<p>When I'm not glued to the computer, I'm practicing piano or taking photos for the school newspaper. I adore horseback riding, Hayao Miyazaki movies, computer programming, and classical music. I have a strong interest and 
					appreciation for graphic design, and recently 
					picked up Guitar Hero 3. Currently, I am a digital artist intern at <a href = http://disneyresearch.com// target = "_blank"; class = "mojo_link">Disney Research</a>,
					and provide assets ranging from 3d modeling, animation, and concept art for various research projects.
