		<div id = "aboutMe">
			<p>I am an Interactive Experience Designer. I love telling stories with art and technology and empowering others to do the same. My passion is expanding the relationship between digital mediums and their potential for interaction.
			</p>

			<p> Currently I work at <a href = "https://www.tiktok.com/" target = "_blank"; class = "link">TikTok</a>, designing creative solutions to challenges in interactive AR experiences.</p>
				
			<!--Last summer I interned at <a href = "https://fable-studio.com/" target = "_blank"; class = "link">Fable Studio</a> as an AR Developer working on experience prototypes on Magic Leap.
