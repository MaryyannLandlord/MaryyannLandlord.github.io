				Steelcase creates innovative furniture for businesses and homes. All of their creation process involves teams of designers, engineers, product managers, and more. Steelcase asked us to imagine a VR workspace for the future, where collaborators can set up remote workspaces that support real-time design discussions and production.

			The question posed by Steelcase was very big &#8212 "<i>What is the future of workspace collaboration? </i>". I began my research by following the "double-diamond design model". First we needed to discover the root problems by taking a step back and examining all of the steps in our client's collaboration process. Is there anything fundamental causing an issue? Is there something XR can bring that could solve those issues and enhance the process?

			The initial phase of research involved understanding the steps that go into workspace collaboration &#8212 establish a prompt, explore designs, conduct in-person or remote feedback, develop the product, and test the product. I started by expanding outwards and creating sketches of situations where people collaborate, such as in classrooms, restaurants, and group activities.

					After converging on several specific problems, I expanded out again to explore the posibilities of solutions. Since most people are new to working in VR, I utilized skeuomorphic designs to ease the transition into VR interactions.

					 I created models for VR tool attachments that mimicked traditional creative tools &#8212 grab, draw, speak, explode. These would become the essential creative tools for our VR workspaces.

						What was the feasibility and cost of updating current working pipelines to an XR workspace? Answering that would require further testing.
