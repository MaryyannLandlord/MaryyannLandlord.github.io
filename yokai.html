			I began the project by researching Yokai in Japanese culture &#8212 what is a Yokai? what's their relationship with people? 
			I found <a target = "_blank" class = "link" href = "https://yokai.com/">Yokai, an illustrated database of Japanese folklore</a>, especially helpful. Throughout this process, I asked myself the following questions &#8212 How do we utilize the physical environment to build a relationship with a digital character?

					I created all of the assets and animations. To find the most trackable character size on the Hololens, I performed multiple tests with different Zashiki sizes. We went with a smaller character with bold colors and spacial sound effects that also helped players follow her around.

				<p>
				 For the set, I created sketches and 3D mockups to give a better sense of space. To emphasize our first experience goal of retaining cultural values, all of the set decor are from traditional Japanese household items &#8212 Kotatsu, Tatami mats, Kamidana Alter. For the virtual interactive objects, I hid clues inside of traditonal Japanese painting scrolls that activated based on a player's position.

				Our approach to designing the experience was quick iteration and repeated playtesting. We first created a text outline to brainstorm the experience flow. I also created storyboard sketches on sticky notes that we could easily reorder.

			<br>
			<p> Throughout this process, I asked the following questions &#8212 How do we make Zashiki believable? How can we utilize both physical and virtual spaces? How do we introduce interaction with minimal Player effort?

					<p>3. Players gain insight into goals through multiple access points</p>
					<br>

						To make Zashiki more believable, I created animations that give Players instant feedback to their actions. To add more immersion, I created many virtual household objects that collide with the physical environment.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Each virtual clue links to a physical puzzle piece Players pick up. Connected with RFID tags, the physical objects will trigger changes in the virtual space, giving Players a moment of magic. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Our main audience had no previous Hololens experience. I replaced unfamiliar Hololens interactions with SMS from a mobile phone and gestures from the virtual character. This lowered the barrier of entry.

					<br>
					 <p>
					 	&#8226 All playtesters successfully finished the main experience, but only 1/4 completed the ending.

					 <br>
					 <p>
					 	&#8226 Age of playtesters ranged from college undergrads to 50 yr old adults.

					 <p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
					 <br>
					 <p>
					 	&#8226 The ending required clearer incentive. Zashiki gestures above the Kotatsu and flys beneath it, but playtesters were not persuaded to look underneath. 
					 </p>
					 <br>
					 <p>
					 	&#8226 Minimizing hololens specific gestures successfully lowered barrier of entry.
