			After returning from Taiwan, we reflected back on a hundred hours of footage we took. We had the experience goals, but where did our team exist in this story? Much of the footage also included us. To explore this topic and use this as an opportunity to experiment with interaction, we built multiple rapid prototypes to show what this journey meant for us.

			A big story challenge is designing a relatable narrative around Ama for an audience who had never met her. My first exploration was using webVR and simple interactions to capture the feeling of folding dumplings at home with my Grandmother (姥姥) and share it with an audience. In this experience, the user selects dumpling skins to fold them into dumplings, while listening to 姥姥 explain the steps for creating authentic dumplings.
